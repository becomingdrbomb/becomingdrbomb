- 👋 Hi, I’m @becomingdrbomb
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how data can be used to target an audience, setting up 
- social parameters for civic research and engagement.
I’m interested in developing  foundations for a modular approach to a culture of 
problem-scoping and design research based on community information needs. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of statistics/probability and fundamentals for 
- developing and building complex business solutions,
-  analyzing and drawing data visualizations, automating business processes, and building 
-  virtual agents for communication using Microsoft Power Platform. 
-💡In the near future, I look forward to developing a sense of how data can be used to craft empowering 
social/cultural/geological narratives that address community information needs. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on solutions to promoting data literacy, careers in data science, 
- educational resources for emerging and transitioning professionals.
